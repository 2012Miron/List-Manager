## What is this?
This is a **List Manager**, like Google keep, but no GUI. Created to edit a data base, or write here a notes.
All commands you can find in the program itself.
And yes, your data only on your computer. Nobody can't read your personal data, or do worsted thigs.

### How it works?
It works easy. Central script, with name "General", load data, and manipulate with him. Script "checker", is check your files, is them on right place. Script "ackter", 
looks at the checker result, and makes a decision based on it (create a folder, files). Script "run-list-manager" is start program.

### Okey, i get it. But what files should be NOT deleted, and renamed?
A system needeatly files is a script "General", and folder "Checker". If you deleted those files, all program is stop working. Script "run-list-manager" is optional, and provides to running scripts in right order

### I'm afraid of the command line, will there be a GUI version?
Not yet, but will be in future.
