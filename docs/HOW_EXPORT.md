## How import data to the list?
For import data, need to make python script who created files .pkl with names "names", "content", "value". Then, need to move them to folder "data", and replace files

## How export data from list?
In folder with program, have folder "data". In this folder, saved list.
There are files value.pkl, content.pkl, names.pkl. In them files data saved.
There files can open with notepad.

I work on export list to Excel directly, and from Excel to list format.
